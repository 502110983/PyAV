Pythonic bindings for [FFmpeg][ffmpeg]/[Libav][libav].

[ffmpeg]: http://ffmpeg.org/
[libav]: http://libav.org/

At least, they will be eventually. For now I'm working my way through some tutorials and writing them in Cython.

In the future, I hope to represent the majority of libav in a Pythonic manner.

Have fun, [Read the Docs](http://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/), and good luck!
