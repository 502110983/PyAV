Herein are the changes to the public API.

We are operating with semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>. However,
we are using v0.x.y as our heavy development period, and will increment `x`
to signal a major change (i.e. backwards incompatibilities) and increment
`y` as a minor change (i.e. backwards compatible features).

0.1.0
